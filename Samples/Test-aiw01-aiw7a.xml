                    <div>
                        <p>This document proposes a framework for encoding the linguistic analysis and interpretation of running text (as opposed to the encoding of isolated displays used as examples
                            in articles or books). This presentation assumes familiarity with the text encoding used in the IT (Interlinear Text) system developed by the Summer Institute of
                            Linguistics (SIL). The MS- DOS version of IT is documented in "How to Use IT: a guide to interlinar text processing," by Gary F. Simons and Larry Versaw (SIL, Dallas, TX,
                            1987), and the Macintosh version in "How to Use IT: interlinear text processing on the Macintosh," by Gary F. Simons and John V. Thomson (Linguist's Software, Edmonds, WA,
                            1988). IT uses backslash markers to tag kinds of information in an analyzed text and uses column alignment to encode the relationships between the elements in different
                            tagged fields. This document suggests how the same kinds of information could be encoded in SGML.</p>

                        <p>The IT documentation illustrates many kinds of information that can be encoded in analyzed texts. The focus in this document is not on the variety of things that can be
                            encoded (and for which we would eventually need to develop tags), but on a basic strategy for encoding text analysis in SGML (particularly where there is simultaneously an
                            analysis of the text at different levels of structure).</p>

                        <p>Most of the discussion below gives the justification for what I am proposing and gives examples to illustrate. There are some specific proposals, however. Where these occur,
                            I have drawn attention to them by setting them apart in an indented paragraph. I have also given each a unique reference number to facilitate future discussion of the
                            proposals. In the discussion below I use some of the terminology of the IT system. The baseline text is the original text being analyzed. The analyses added to the text are
                            called annotations.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <head>Word-level analysis</head>

                        <p> I will begin with a simple example (from page 2-19 of the IT manual) which involves only word-level annotation: </p>
                        <!-- 
     \ot Ma  nau ku rikia kini  eri  ne  kuu   ka  bula
     \rt Ma  nau ku rikia kini  'eri ne  ku'u  ka  bula
     \wg and I   I  saw   woman that who drank she be drunk
    -->
                        <annotationBlock>
                            <seg type="ot">Ma nau ku rikia kini eri ne kuu ka bula</seg>
                            <seg type="rt">Ma nau ku rikia kini 'eri ne ku'u ka bula</seg>
                            <seg type="wg">and I I saw woman that who drank she be drunk</seg>
                        </annotationBlock>
                        
                        <annotationBlock>
                            <seg type="ot"><w>Ma</w> <w>nau</w> <w>ku</w> <w>rikia</w> <w>kini</w> <w>eri</w> <w>ne</w> <w>kuu</w> <w>ka</w> <w>bula</w></seg>
                            <seg type="rt"><w>Ma</w> <w>nau</w> <w>ku</w> <w>rikia</w> <w>kini</w> <w>'eri</w> <w>ne</w> <w>ku'u</w> <w>ka</w> <w>bula</w></seg>
                            <seg type="wg"><w>and</w> <w>I</w> <w>I</w> <w>saw</w> <w>woman</w> <w>that</w> <w>who</w> <w>drank</w> <w>she</w> <w>be drunk</w></seg>
                        </annotationBlock>


                        <p>Here, \ot stands for `original transcription,' \rt for `retranscription,' and \wg for `word gloss.' </p>
                        <p> In the interlinear presentation of text, the associations between words and their annotations are achieved by means of explicit manipulation of format. In a data
                            interchange standard we need to get away from that, for at least two reasons: (1) the actual formatting (such as the size of the spaces between words) is dependent on the
                            size and style of the fonts that are eventually used, and (2) software could not understand the structure of an interlinear text (and the relationships among its elements)
                            without having a special purpose parser. To remedy this, the interchange standard should explicitly encode the structure of the interlinear text in its descriptive markup.
                            This leads to the first proposal:</p>

                        <p> 1. A markup element, say <tag type="start">w</tag> ... <tag type="end">w</tag>, is needed to enclose a word and all of its annotations in an interlinear text.</p>

                        <p>Within this element, the base word and each of the annotations are also marked with a descriptive tag. I will assume that the DTD specifies that end tags are optional for
                            these lowest level tags. Following this scheme, the above example (keeping the same markup tags) would be encoded as:</p>

                            </w>
                        </egXML>

                        <p> In this example, a space has been put after each data item. It is my feeling that the standard should ignore any white space following a data item within a <gi>w</gi>
                            element. This flexibility is needed, especially as analysis structures get more complex, in order to make interchange formats human readable. Thus,</p>
                        <p> 2. Within the <gi>w</gi> element, all spaces and newlines preceding a markup tag are superfluous. </p>
                        <p>Thus the above sample means exactly the same thing as the following in which all the superfluous spaces are omitted (thus producing a file that is highly compact but much
                            less human readable): </p>
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                            <w><ot>Ma</ot><rt>Ma</rt><wg>and</wg></w>
                            <w><ot>nau</ot><rt>nau</rt><wg>I</wg></w>
                            <w><ot>ku</ot><rt>ku</rt><wg>I</wg></w>
                            <w><ot>rikia</ot><rt>rikia</rt><wg>saw</wg></w>

                        </egXML>

                        <!--
Likewise, the above two encodings are equivalent to the following
in which extra spaces are added to achieve a very human readable
format:
 
     <w> <ot>Ma    <rt>Ma    <wg>and      </w>
     <w> <ot>nau   <rt>nau   <wg>I        </w>
     <w> <ot>ku    <rt>ku    <wg>I        </w>
     <w> <ot>rikia <rt>rikia <wg>saw      </w>
     <w> <ot>kini  <rt>kini  <wg>woman    </w>
     <w> <ot>eri   <rt>'eri  <wg>that     </w>
     <w> <ot>ne    <rt>ne    <wg>who      </w>
     <w> <ot>kuu   <rt>ku'u  <wg>drank    </w>
     <w> <ot>ka    <rt>ka    <wg>she      </w>
     <w> <ot>bula  <rt>bula  <wg>be drunk </w>
 
The following is still another possible encoding of the very same
information:
 
     <w>
        <ot>Ma
        <rt>Ma
        <wg>and </w>
     <w>
        <ot>nau
        <rt>nau
        <wg>I </w>
     <w>
        <ot>ku
        <rt>ku
        <wg>I </w>
     <w>
        <ot>rikia
        <rt>rikia
        <wg>saw </w>
     etc.
 -->
                        <p>The examples below which involve morpheme analysis within word analysis demonstrate the necessity for being able to treat newlines as well as spaces as superfluous. </p>
                        <p> I further propose, as shown in the above samples, that: </p>
                        <p> 3. Within the <gi>w</gi> element, the baseline text element should have a markup tag just as do all the annotations.</p>

                        <p>This means that <gi>w</gi> will always be followed immediately by the baseline tag. This appears redundant, and one could argue that the baseline word should be the content
                            of the <gi>w</gi> tag. I prefer to have the baseline separately tagged for the following reasons: (1) The <gi>w</gi> element is more like a record of a database than an
                            element with running text; in this perspective, the baseline word is a field of information as are all the annotations. (2) The baseline text may be drawn from any of a
                            number of domains -- phonetic transcription, phonemic transcription, standard orthography, historical orthography -- which happen to be among the domains that are possible
                            for annotations as well. This proposal ensures that elements are tagged consistently, whether they are base forms or annotations. (3) If the baseline were not tagged, then
                            the meaning of <gi>w</gi> would be variable depending on the kind of representation being used for the baseline. With the baseline separately tagged, <gi>w</gi> always
                            means exactly the same thing, namely, "This is a bundle of information about a word."</p>

                        <p> Now we shift to a more complex example involving morpheme- level analysis within the word-level analysis. The example is from Eskimo, a highly agglutinative language. In
                            interlinear format (from page 2-33 of the IT manual) the example looks like this:</p>

                        <p>The field codes in this case are \tx for `baseline text,' \at for `allomorphic transcription' (that is, with morph cuts indicated in the surface form of the word), \mr for
                            `morphemic representa- tion' (that is, underlying forms), \mg for `morpheme gloss,' and \wg for `word gloss.'</p>

                        <p> In this example we have the elements of the baseline text and the word gloss lines working at the word level. But the middle three lines are further subdivided into a

                        <p>Note that in this representation we have preserved the morpheme break characters in the data so that the human reader can reconstruct the relationships between the parts of
                            the related lines, but we have not encoded those relationships explicitly in the markup. Without a special purpose parser, the morpheme subalignments are lost to computer
                            software.</p>

                        <p> To handle the morphemic substructure in the markup, we need an element like <gi>w</gi> above, but which works at the morpheme level and can be embedded inside <gi>w</gi>
                            elements. Thus,</p>

                        <p>4. A markup element, say <tag type="start">m</tag> ... <tag type="end">m</tag>, is needed to enclose a morpheme and all of its annotations in an interlinear text.</p>

                        <p>Proposal 2 above, about superfluous newlines and spaces, applies as well within the scope of the <gi>m</gi> element. So does proposal 3, which in this case means that the
                            first item within a <gi>m</gi> element should have a descriptive tag.</p>

                        <p> To translate the above interlinear example into descriptive SGML markup requires one more step. We must realize that the three lines which will be expressed at the morpheme
                            level inside <gi>m</gi> elements function together as a single element at the word level. In the same way that \wg provides a gloss for the whole word, the set of three
                            lines provides a morphemic analysis for the whole word. We thus introduce <gi>ma</gi> for `morphemic analysis' as a word-level annotation in which to embed the
                            morpheme-level analyses. The descriptive markup of the Eskimo example then becomes something like: </p>

                        <p>Text analysis must also go above the word level. For instance, the free translations of conventional interlinear text analysis are annotations at a sentence or clause level.
                            One could also perform analysis and annotation at a phrase level or at a paragraph level. Markup can be generalized at any level by doing what we did to embed morpheme
                            analysis inside word level analysis. Thus,</p>

                        <p> 5. For each level at which annotation is to be done, a markup tag (along the lines of <gi>w</gi> and <gi>m</gi> introduced above) should be created. If a lower level of
                            anno- tation is to be embedded within it, then a markup tag to embed the lower level analysis must also be created.</p>

                        <p>The second sentence refers to a tag like <gi>ma</gi> which had to be created to embed morpheme analyses inside of word analyses. </p>
                        <p> Consider this example (adapted from page 2-64 of the IT manual):</p>

                        <p> For the purposes of text glossing, this particular text was divided into units of convenient size for translation (often more than a single clause but less than a

                            unit. Within the unit, we have word-level analysis. Thus we need a tag to embed the lower level of analysis. We will use <gi>wa</gi> for `word-by-word analysis.' The above

                        <head>Where next?</head>
                        <p> My purpose here has been to suggest a possible framework for the markup of analysis and interpretation in texts. If this framework is adopted, then it seems that the major
                            task of the committee would be to devise a standard set of tags for all the kinds of information that could be encoded in analyzed texts. The IT manual proposes more than
                            30, but many more are possible. The following are some of the difficulties I foresee along the way:</p>

                        <p> (1) This kind of text is not amenable to the once-for-all DTD in the same way that something like an academic book or article (a la the AAP tag set) has proven to be. Two
                            reasons come to mind. First, there is not a closed tag set. The imaginative analyst could invent new ways of interpreting and analyzing text for which appropriate
                            standardized markup tags have not been devised. Second, each analyzed text potentially has a unique DTD rather than all analyzed texts sharing the same DTD. In a particular
                            analyzed text, the analyst makes a selection of the kinds of information that will be included; the analyst should then be consistent in following that model throughout.
                            The analyst's selection thus would ideally define a unique DTD for the text which consistently enforces the analyst's intention. We could probably live with a once-for-all
                            general- purpose DTD, but it would permit sloppy work in which each element of the text could be annotated with a different selection of fields.</p>

                        <p> (2) The whole scheme presented above is optimal for situations where there is a one-to-one correspondence between all the analysis items at the same level. What do we do
                            when there is not? For instance, what happens if one word in the baseline text is a contraction that needs to be represented as two words in the next line of the analysis.
                            Or, what if two words in the baseline text are a single lexeme which should be represented as a single item in a later line of analysis. This problem gets even more
                            difficult when the items involved are discontinuous.</p>

                        <p> (3) The example above shows only a traditional single-tier approach to morphology. Encoding of multiple-tier analyses will be tricky because the associations between
                            elements on different tiers are typically not one-to-one.</p>

                        <p>(4) It is unclear to me how encoding the interpretation and analysis of a running text (which is what this working paper considers) should relate to the encoding of
                            linguistic examples in a book or article. It seems pretty obvious that the encoding of interlinear examples can be covered by the same mechanism. For other kinds of
                            examples, such as syntactic tree diagrams or the multi-tier displays common in phonology, it is not so clear. It seems that it would be possible to force these into the
                            above model (and indeed we probably want this for the case where these kinds of analysis are used in annotating a running text). However, it also seems that it might be
                            better to have a separate encoding scheme optimized for these special kinds of displays.</p>
